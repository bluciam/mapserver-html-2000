The pre-ACMS (2000)
===================

This site served as the design basis for the development of the 
multilingual, interactive, coopearive mapping server called later
the Anica Conti Mapping Server.

This is purely html with a cgi script in perl, all written by hand,
no css or similar at all!

The cgi script requires 'pscoast' from the GMT software suit 
and pstoimg.
